### features:
- [java](./java) and [python](./python) solutions
- explanations for all uses of regex (regexplanations?) are included
- doc comments for everything
- nearly all of the solutions are one-liners
  - some have line breaks for readability though

  <summary>About imports</summary>

  CodingBat automatically imports `java.util.*` and `java.util.stream.Collectors`,
  so for anything that's not those, i use fully qualified names.
