The shortest solutions to [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/) problems that I can come up with.
### features:
- explanations for all uses of regex (regexplanations?) are included
- nearly all of the solutions are one-liners
  - some have line breaks for readability though

  <summary>About imports</summary>
  
  Imports in CodingBat are kind of weird, for example `java.util.stream.Collectors` is automatically imported
  but `java.util.stream.IntStream` is not.
  I'll use imports in my files for when CodingBat automatically imports it for you, otherwise I'll use FQNs.
